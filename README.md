# Analize the language programming
--------------------------------------
This project was born reading [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org) and [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com)
.

This application runs the web scraping to Wikipedia, writes a file with the data and analize the dataset about the programming languages.



## Feature

* [O] Reading and merging the data of languages about the error handling
* [O] Calculating the accuracy of the models
* [O] Using some other pages of wikipedia not by web scraping but using the archives

## Bug

[O]  Organize the structure of the project and code following the guidelines in [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python!](https://docs.python-guide.org/)

## Legend: 
* [O] Doing in future in an apposite branch
* [X] Done in the past and delivered in master

## Status CI Integration
 
I use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
